# IntelliJ setup

This folder contains the setup to get as close to a neovim setup as possible with IntelliJ Ultimate.

IdeaVim is the official vim plugin for IntelliJ by Jetbrains. 
The configurations sets up some plugins that have to be installed prior to the activation of the plugin.
In addition to that it sets some good standard settings like using the system clipboard and adjusting the history.

The second part of the repository is the configuration for a plugin called ataman. 
It serves as a leader-style keybind launcher based on my neovim keybinds.
