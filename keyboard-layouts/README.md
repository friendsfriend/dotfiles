# Keyboard layout instructions for Mac

This folder contains a script to install the standard keyboard layouts for my personal MacOS setup.

It selects:
* German Mac Layout (internal macbook keyboard)
* German Standard PC layout (Rainy 75 or other Windows keyboards)
* Custom version of the US layout (part of this repository) with German Umlauts 

The custom layout cannot be added via a script. 
Therefore you have to add it manually. 
System Settings > Keyboard > Layouts > + > US International Linux

## Custom Layout content

* Alt + P = ö
* Alt + Shift + P = Ö
* Alt + Q = ä
* Alt + Shift + Ä
* Alt + Y = ü
* Alt + Shift + Y = Ü
* Alt + S = ß
