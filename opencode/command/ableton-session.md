Get a comprehensive overview of the current Ableton Live session by calling `get_session_info`. Format the results as an organized report showing:

1. **Transport** — tempo, time signature, playing state, loop settings
2. **Tracks** — list all tracks with type, name, color, arm/mute/solo state
3. **Scenes** — scene names and clip occupancy
4. **Master** — master volume and devices

After presenting the overview, ask if the user wants to dive deeper into any specific track, device, or area.
