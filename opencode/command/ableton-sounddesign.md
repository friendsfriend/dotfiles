description: Sound design workflow — load instruments and effects, shape parameters for a target sound
---

Guide the user through designing a sound. Follow these steps:

1. **Ask about the target sound** — what character? (warm pad, aggressive bass, shimmering lead, atmospheric texture, etc.)
2. **Choose an instrument** — pick the right synth for the job, load it with `find_and_load_device`
3. **Get parameters** — `get_device_parameters` to see what's available
4. **Shape the sound** — `set_device_parameter` or `batch_set_parameters` to dial in the character
5. **Add effects** — load effects (reverb, delay, chorus, distortion, etc.) and tweak their parameters
6. **Create a test pattern** — `create_clip` + `add_notes` with a simple pattern to audition
7. **Fire the clip** to listen, iterate based on feedback

Explain what each parameter does as you adjust it. Use `undo` liberally if something sounds wrong.
